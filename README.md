## Projeto - Guide to Exploratory Data Analysis with Python and SQL Language

In this Project we will present a basic guide to exploratory data analysis using Python Language, SQL Language and SQLite Database. We will use actual publicly available movies, data about data on <a href="http://www.imdb.com/interfaces/">IMDB</a>.

When applying Exploratory Data Analysis we will answer these 10 questions:

- 1- What are the most common movie categories on IMDB?
- 2- What is the number of titles per genre?
- 3- What is the median rating of the movies by genre?
- 4- What is the median rating of the movies by year of release?
- 5- What is the Number of Films Evaluated by Genre in relation to the Release Year?
- 6- What is the Movie with the Longest Running Time? Calculate the Percentiles.
- 7- What is the Relationship between Running Time and Genre?
- 8- What is the Number of Films Produced by Country?
- 9- What are the Top 10 Best Movies?
- 10- What are the Top 10 Worst Movies?
